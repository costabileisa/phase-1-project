# Phase 1 Project

This is the end of Phase 1 project for Flatiron School.
Webpage can be found at: https://lalllic.github.io/phase-1-project/
## Requirements
The requirements for this project included the following:
- Must be written in HTML/CSS/JS that accesses a public API with no auth key
- Must be a single page application
- Use three different event listeners
- Must have one instance of array iteration
- Keep code clean; utilize functions to prevent repeating code

## Features
- The page will load a list of public APIs from this [Public API for Public APIs]
- It immediately filters out the ones that require an auth key, so it only displays the ones that do not require an auth key
- The info about the APIs that is displayed has been filtered to only include the name, a short description, and the link
- On keypress, it will display only the APIs whose first letter matches the key pressed
- On click, the background of the page will turn pink (hex color #ffd1dc)
